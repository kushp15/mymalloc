Description: 
To Compile the Enter directory Write make in command prompt and then type ./mymalloc to execute.

Test Plan:
1. malloc() and immediately free() a 1-byte chunk, 120 times.

2. Use malloc() to get 120 1-byte chunks, storing the pointers in an array, then use free() to deallocate the chunks.

3. Randomly choose between
      •Allocating a 1-byte chunk and storing the pointer in an array
      •Deallocating one of the chunks in the array (if any)
    Repeat until you have called malloc() 120 times, then free all remaining allocated chunks.
    
4. Allocating 120 chunks together at size same size, then trying to free them separately also immediately malloc with different sizes. Finally, Free all memory
5. First allocating all the chunks together but with the different sizes, also separately free the memory.
